## Access .Rdata

Larger assets can be accessed from within a report using
[`piggyback`](https://github.com/ropensci/piggyback)!

``` r
# Install and load R package
require(piggyback)

# Create temporary directory and load .Rdata into R environment,
pb_download(file = "default.RData",dest = tempdir(),repo = "mohabazzi/AptianShark",tag = "v.01")
load(file = file.path(tempdir(),"default.RData"))
```

[r](/data) contains all data file analysed in this study.
